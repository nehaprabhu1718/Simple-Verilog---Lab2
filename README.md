# Simple-Verilog---Lab2
This project is a part of my CS233 class (Computer Architecture). Here, I built a simple working ALU using Verilog. 

My goal with this project was to understand Verilog better, and use its features to build a simple 32-bit ALU. My contribution to this code is in the alu32 module, where I output three signals - overflow, negative, and zero. I tested my coding my compiling to a Makefile and running the given test cases on gtkwave.
